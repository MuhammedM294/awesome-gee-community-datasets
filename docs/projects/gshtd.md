# Global Seamless High-resolution Temperature Dataset (GSHTD)

The Global Seamless High-resolution Temperature Dataset (GSHTD) presented in this study offers a comprehensive and valuable resource for researchers across various fields. Covering the period from 2001 to 2020, this dataset focuses on land surface temperature (Ts) and near-surface air temperature (Ta). A unique feature of GSHTD is its incorporation of seven types of temperature data, including clear-sky daytime and nighttime Ts, all-sky daytime and nighttime Ts, and mean, maximum, and minimum Ta. Notably, the dataset achieves global coverage with an impressive 30 arcsecond or 1km spatial resolution.

The development of GSHTD involves the innovative Estimation of Temperature Difference (ETD) method, enabling the reconstruction of both clear- and cloudy-sky Ts. The dataset is seamless, eliminating missing values, and employs a Cubist machine learning algorithm to enhance accuracy in creating monthly averages of mean, maximum, and minimum Ta data. GSHTD exhibits high accuracy, outperforming existing methods with average mean absolute errors (MAEs) that are significantly lower. This dataset's accessibility at the Middle Yangtze River Geoscience Data Center provides a valuable tool for studies related to climate change, environmental science, ecology, epidemiology, and human health.
