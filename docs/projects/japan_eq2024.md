# Sea of Japan Earthquake 2024

The 2024 Sea of Japan earthquake occurred on January 1, 2024, after 4:00 PM (Japan time), resulting in significant damage,
including building collapses, landslides, and fires at various locations. In response to requests from domestic disaster
prevention agencies, JAXA conducted emergency observations using ALOS-2 from the night of the disaster. The released data
includes Level 2.1 (GeoTIFF) and archive data, facilitating interference analysis and change detection to contribute to
disaster reduction and prevention. Notably, this publicly released data is intended for non-commercial purposes, including
government and local authority use, as well as research by universities.

#### Dataset preprocessing
Additional metadata was added to the images in the collection. Field names such as system:time_start and system:time_end were added to make the collection filterable in Google Earth Engine. Custom code was written for ingest into Google Earth Engine and a no data value of 0 was used for masking.
