The DEMs are derived from satellite sub-meter stereo imagery, particularly from WorldView 1-3 and GeoEye-1. The processing of the DEMs was done using SETSM, an open-source digital photogrammetric software, in the Bluewaters supercomputer (University of Ilinois). Each DEM has 2x2m resolution and a footprint of ~18x100km.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn a collaborative effort between the National Land Survey of Iceland, the Icelandic Meteorological Office and the Polar Geospatial Center, we developed methods to handle and process a large amount of data available for Iceland. The methods developed consisted of:\u00a0\n> - Spatial adjustment of all the available DEMs, for homogeneity and consistency in the location of each individual DEM.\n\n>\n> - Robust mosaicking into one single DEM of Iceland, by taking advantage of the multi-temporal coverage of DEMs. Each pixel of the mosaic corresponds to a median elevation value from the possible elevations available from the ArcticDEM.\u00a0\n\n\nThis DEM is resampled for 10x10m resolution.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n_________________\n\u00a0For visualization use code:\u00a0https://code.earthengine.google.com/2254120a9fb2d553c150e2eb8212ab6e?hideCode=true",
